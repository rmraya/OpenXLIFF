# OpenXLIFF Filters

![OpenXLIFF FIlters logo](openxliff_128.png)

An open source set of Java filters for creating, merging and validating XLIFF 1.2, 2.0, 2.1 and 2.2 files.

With OpenXLIFF Filters you can create XLIFF files that don't use proprietary markup and are compatible with most CAT (Computer Asisted Translation) tools.

## Building OpenXLIFF Filters

### Requirements

- JDK 21 or newer is required for compiling and building. Pre-built binaries already include everything you need to run all options.
- Gradle 8.14.3 or newer. get it from [Gradle Releases](https://gradle.org/releases/).

### Steps for building

- Checkout this repository.
- Point your JAVA_HOME variable to JDK 21
- Run `gradle` to generate a binary distribution in `./dist`

``` bash
  git clone https://github.com/rmraya/OpenXLIFF.git
  cd OpenXLIFF
  gradle
```

A binary distribution will be created in `/dist` folder.

## Convert Document to XLIFF

You can use the library in your own Java code. Conversion to XLIFF is handled by the class `com.maxprograms.converters.Convert`.

If you use binaries from the command line, running `.\convert.cmd` or `./convert.sh` without parameters displays help for XLIFF generation.

```text
Usage:

convert.sh [-help] [-version] -file sourceFile -srcLang sourceLang 
        [-tgtLang targetLang] [-skl skeletonFile] [-xliff xliffFile] 
        [-type fileType] [-enc encoding] [-srx srxFile] [-catalog catalogFile] 
        [-divatal ditaval] [-config configFile] [-embed] [-paragraph] 
        [-xmlfilter folder] [-2.0] [-2.1] [-2.2] [-ignoretc] [-ignoresvg] [-strict]
        [-charsets] [-types]

Where:

   -help:      (optional) display this help information and exit
   -version:   (optional) display version & build information and exit
   -file:      source file to convert
   -srcLang:   source language code
   -tgtLang:   (optional) target language code
   -xliff:     (optional) XLIFF file to generate
   -skl:       (optional) skeleton file to generate
   -type:      (optional) document type
   -enc:       (optional) character set code for the source file
   -srx:       (optional) SRX file to use for segmentation
   -catalog:   (optional) XML catalog to use for processing
   -ditaval:   (optional) conditional processing file to use when converting DITA maps
   -config:    (optional) configuration file to use when converting JSON documents
   -embed:     (optional) store skeleton inside the XLIFF file
   -paragraph: (optional) use paragraph segmentation
   -xmlfilter: (optional) folder containing configuration files for the XML filter
   -ignoretc:  (optional) ignore tracked changes from Oxygen XML Editor in XML files
   -ignoresvg: (optional) ignore translatable SVG files when parsing DITA maps
   -2.0:       (optional) generate XLIFF 2.0
   -2.1:       (optional) generate XLIFF 2.1
   -2.2:       (optional) generate XLIFF 2.2
   -strict:    (optional) validate QTI files/packages
   -charsets:  (optional) display a list of available character sets and exit
   -types:     (optional) display a list of supported document types and exit
```

Only two parameters are absolutely required: `-file` and `-srcLang`. The library tries to automatically detect format and encoding and exits with an error message if it can't guess them. If automatic detection doesn't work, add `-type` and `-enc` parameters.

Character sets vary with the operating system. Run the conversion script with `-charsets` to get a list of character sets available in your OS.

By default, XLIFF and skeleton are generated in the folder where the source document is located. Extensions used for XLIFF and Skeleton are `.xlf` and `.skl`.

The `XML` type handles multiple document formats, like `XHTML`, `SVG` or `DocBook` files.

Default XML catalog and SRX file are provided. You can also use custom versions if required.

If you use binaries from the command line, running `.\iceMatches.cmd` or `./iceMatches.sh` without parameters displays help for recovering ICE Matches.

```text
Usage:

iceMatches.sh [-help] -old oldXliff -new newXliff [-catalog catalogFile]

Where:

    -help:    (optional) Display this help information and exit
    -old:     XLIFF file with previous translations
    -new:     XLIFF file that receives previous translations
    -catalog: (optional) XML catalog to use for processing
```

## XLIFF Validation

The original [XLIFFChecker code](http://sourceforge.net/p/xliffchecker/code/) supports XLIFF 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2. The new version incorporated in OpenXLIFF Filters also supports XLIFF 2.0.

Standard XML Schema validation does not detect the use of duplicated 'id' attributes, wrong language codes and other constraints written in the different XLIFF specifications.

All XLIFF 2.0 modules are validated using XML Schema validation in a first pass. Extra validation is then performed using Java code for XLIFF 2.0 Core and for Metadata, Matches and Glossary modules.

You can validate XLIFF files using your own Java code. Validation of XLIFF files is handled by the class `com.maxprograms.validation.XliffChecker`.

If you use binaries from the command line, running `.\xliffchecker.cmd` or `./xliffchecker.sh` without parameters displays help for XLIFF validation.

```text
Usage:

   xliffchecker.cmd [-help] -file xliffFile [-catalog catalogFile]

Where:

   -help:      (optional) Display this help information and exit
   -file:      XLIFF file to validate
   -catalog:   (optional) XML catalog to use for processing
```

### XLIFF Validation Service

## Translation Status Analysis

This library lets you produce an HTML file with word counts and segment status statistics from an XLIFF file.  

If you use binaries from the command line, running `.\analysis.cmd` or `./analysis.sh` without parameters displays help for statistics generation.

You can generate statistics using your own Java code. Statistics generation is handled by the class `com.maxprograms.stats.RepetitionAnalysis`.

```text
Usage:

   analysis.sh [-help] -file xliffFile [-catalog catalogFile]

Where:

   -help:      (optional) Display this help information and exit
   -file:      XLIFF file to analyze
   -catalog:   (optional) XML catalog to use for processing
```

The HTML report is generated in the folder where the XLIFF file is located and its name is the name of the XLIFF plus `.log.html`.

## Join multiple XLIFF files

You can combine several XLIFF files into a larger one using class `com.maxprograms.converters.Join` from your Java code or using the provided scripts.

Running `.\join.cmd` or `./join.sh` without parameters displays help for joining files.

exporttmx.sh [-help] -xliff xliffFile [-tmx tmxFile] [-catalog catalogFile]

Where:

    -help:      (optional) Display this help information and exit
    -xliff:     XLIFF file to process
    -tmx:       (optional) TMX file to generate
    -catalog:   (optional) XML catalog to use for processing
```

If the optional `-tmx` parameter is not provided, the TMX file will be generated in the same folder as the XLIFF file and its name will be the same as the XLIFF file plus `.tmx`.
